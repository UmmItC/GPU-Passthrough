# Introduction

>This section is part of the Dual GPU-Passthrough, which means also is the most expensive and best setup.

With dual GPU passthrough, you can essentially use one PC to run two separate systems simultaneously. This setup allows you to play with two different distributions or other systems without needing to buy additional hardware. You can connect two monitors, keyboards, and mice, enabling you to use both systems independently on the same computer.

For the best experience with dual GPU passthrough, always use two or more devices to interact with your system.

## Why Two Monitors?

As mentioned earlier, using two monitors allows you to display both your main screen and the GPU passthrough VM’s screen simultaneously. This setup effectively provides two systems running within a single computer.

While you could connect the second GPU to the same monitor and switch between inputs manually, this approach can be cumbersome and inconvenient.

## Why Two Keyboards?

After GPU passthrough, the main system cannot use the keyboard to control the VM. The keyboard is passed through to the VM, so it's best to have two keyboards: one for the main system and one for the VM.

## Why Two Mice?

Similarly, you cannot use the mouse on the passthrough system to control the main screen. Therefore, you’ll need an additional mouse to operate the main screen.

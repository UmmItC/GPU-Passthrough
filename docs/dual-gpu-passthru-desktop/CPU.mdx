# How to Buy a CPU

To enable GPU passthrough, you need a CPU that supports virtualization. Without this capability, your system won’t be able to run GPU passthrough effectively. Here’s how to choose the right CPU.

## CPU Virtualization Support

Virtualization support is crucial for efficient virtual machine performance and successful GPU passthrough. You'll need to enable this feature in your BIOS after selecting a suitable CPU.

> As of 2024, most CPUs include this feature by default. However, it's still important to verify that your CPU supports it!

To check if your CPU supports virtualization:

1. Visit the official website of your CPU manufacturer.
2. Look for the specifications or features section related to virtualization support.
3. Confirm that your CPU supports virtualization technology (Intel VT-x or AMD-V).

| AMD CPU   | Intel CPU |
|-----------|-----------|
| IOMMU     | VT-d      |
| NX Mode   | VT-x      |
| SVM Mode  |           |

Ensuring that your CPU has proper virtualization support is a crucial step for setting up dual GPU passthrough successfully.

# How to Buy a GPU

Choosing a GPU is straightforward, but there are a few considerations based on your needs.

In general, just pick the GPU you want. 

From a GNU/Linux perspective, AMD GPUs are recommended, while Nvidia GPUs are better suited for Windows.

For optimal setup:
- **AMD Radeon RX 7000 Series** for the GNU/Linux host
- **RTX 4000 Series** for the Windows guest

If you prefer using a GNU/Linux guest, it's best to use two AMD GPUs.

and yeah. Dont even think Nvidia GPU for GNU/Linux, if dose, this is the worst choice you ever done.

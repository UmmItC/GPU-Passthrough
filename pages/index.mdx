# Introduction

Hi, welcome to our website! Here, you'll find everything you need to know about GPU passthrough.

## So, what exactly is GPU passthrough?
> **In short, GPU passthrough lets you pass your real GPU into a virtual machine.**

Not a virtual GPU. This means the virtual machine gets direct access to the physical GPU.
Play games or run applications within that virtual machine. 

## Why? It sounds stupid.

I always got a similar question. Here are some answers:

- It's more secure and you don't need to install an OS on your computer. Everything runs in the virtual machine.
- You don't want to have two operating systems on your computer because it takes up space.
- You hate Windows and some software on Windows is more stable than on GNU/Linux. (like DaVinci Resolve)
- You're doing some production testing and need a GPU environment to install another GNU/Linux distro.
